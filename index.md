After cloning the repo I used the command `cd` to get into the correct directory. 

**Adding the branch `add-read-me` and switching into it**

Once I was in the editor I used my mousepad to go to the first line and add `Ria's User Page` then used `Ctrl+0` to save and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

**Adding and committing the changes**

I used the `git add` command to add the new file and I used `git commit` to commit the changes with the message "Add Ria's User Page to README"

**Pushing the changes**

I used the `git push --set-upstream origin add-read-me` command to push my commit to the remote branch. 

**Acknowledge that the commit message should have been `Update readme file.`**

There is a new `.gitignore` file which will ignore the `PRIVATE.txt` file I created containing my name and ID number.
